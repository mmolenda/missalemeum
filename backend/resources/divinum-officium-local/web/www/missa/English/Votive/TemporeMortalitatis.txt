[Lectio]
Lesson from the first book of Kings
! 2 Kgs 24:15-19, 24:25
In those days: The Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel, from the morning unto~
the time appointed, and there died of the people from Dan to Bersabee seventy~
thousand men. And when the Angel of the Lord had stretched out his hand over~
Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord had pity on the affliction, and said to the~
Angel that slew the people: It is enough: now hold thy hand. And the Angel of~
the Lord was by the thrashing-floor of Areuna the Jebusite. And David said to~
the Lord, when he saw the Angel striking the people: It is I, I am he that have~
sinned, I have done wickedly: these that are the sheep, what have they done?~
Let Thy hand, I beseech Thee, be turned against me, and against my father’s~
house. And the Prophet Gad came to David that day, and said: Go up, and build~
an altar to the Lord in the thrashing-floor of Areuna the Jebusite. And David~
went up according to the word of Gad which the Lord had commanded him: and he~
built there an altar to the Lord, and offered holocausts and peace-offerings:~
and the Lord became merciful to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
