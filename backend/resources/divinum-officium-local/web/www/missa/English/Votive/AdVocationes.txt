Lesson from the first book of Kings
! 1 Kgs 3:1-10
In those days: The child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli, and the~
word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no manifest vision. And~
it came to pass one day when Heli lay in his place, and his eyes were grown~
dim, that he could not see: before the lamp of God went out, Samuel slept in~
the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was. And the Lord called Samuel.~
And he answered: Here am I. And he ran to Heli and said: Here am I: for thou~
didst call me. He said: I did not call: go back and sleep. And he went and~
slept. And the Lord called Samuel again. And Samuel arose and went to Heli, and~
said: Here am I: for thou calledst me. He answered: I did not call thee, my~
son: return and sleep. Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither had the~
word of the Lord been revealed to him. And the Lord called Samuel again the~
third time. And he arose up and went to Heli, and said: Here am I: for thou~
didst call me. Then Heli understood that the Lord called the child, and he said~
to Samuel: Go, and sleep: and if He shall call thee any more, thou shalt say:~
Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and slept in his place.~
And the Lord came and stood: and He called, as He had called the other times:~
Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel said: Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to St. John.
!John 1:35-51
At that time: John stood, and two of his disciples. And beholding Jesus walking,~
he saith: Behold the Lamb of God. And the two disciples heard him speak, and~
they followed Jesus. And Jesus turning, and seeing them following him, saith to~
them: What seek you? Who said to Him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted,~
Master), where dwellest Thou? He saith to them: Come and see. They came, and saw~
where He abode, and they stayed with Him that day: now it was about the tenth~
hour. And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who had heard~
of John, and followed Him. He findeth first his brother Simon, and saith to him:~
We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And he~
brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said: Thou art Simon the son~
of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is interpreted Peter. On the~
following day, He would go forth into Galilee, and He findeth Philip. And Jesus~
saith to him: Follow me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and~
Peter. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him: We have found Him of whom~
Moses in the law, and the prophets did write, Jesus the son of Joseph of~
Nazareth. And Nathanael said to him: Can any thing of good come from Nazareth?~
Philip saith to him: Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him: and He~
saith of him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile. Nathanael~
saith to Him: Whence knowest Thou me? Jesus answered, and said to him: Before~
that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. Nathanael~
answered Him, and said: Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God, Thou art the King of~
Israel. Jesus answered, and said to him: Because I said unto thee, I saw thee~
under the fig tree, thou believest: greater things than these shalt thou see.~
And He saith to him: Amen, amen I say to you, you shall see the heaven opened,~
and the Angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
