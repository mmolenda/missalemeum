[De lectione Evangelica]
! When the palms have been distributed the deacon puts the gospel book on the altar and the priest puts incense into the thurible.  The prayer Munda Cor is said as usual, and the Gospel is sung by the deacon with all the ceremonies usual at High Mass.

v. Cleanse my heart and my lips, O almighty God, who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet Isaias with a burning coal, and vouchsafe, through Thy gracious mercy, so to purify me, that I may worthily announce Thy holy Gospel. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
D. Sir, give me thy blessing.

! The priest answers:

P. The Lord be in thy heart and on thy lips, that thou mayest worthily and in a becoming manner, proclaim His holy Gospel. In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, + and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
P. The Lord be with you.
S. And with thy spirit.

Continuation ++ of the holy Gospel according to Matthew.
R. Glory be to Thee, O Lord.

!Matt 21:1-9
At that time, when Jesus drew nigh to Jerusalem, and was come to Bethphage, unto Mount Olivet, then He sent two disciples, saying to them: Go ye into the village that is over against you, and immediately you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them and bring them to Me.  And if any man shall say anything to you, say ye, that the Lord hath need of them: and forthwith he will let them go.  Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: Tell ye the daughter of Sion: Behold thy King cometh to thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of her that is used to the yoke.  And the disciples going, did as Jesus commanded them.  And they brought the ass and the colt, and laid their garments upon them, and made him sit thereon.  And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way: and others cut boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way, and the multitudes that went before and that followed, cried, saying: Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.
R. Praise be to Thee, O Christ.
S. By the words of the Gospel may our sins be blotted out.

! The procession now takes place.  When the priest places incense in the thurible, the deacon, turning toward the people, sings, the choir responding:

V. Let us go forth in peace.

R. In the name of Christ. Amen.

! The thurifer precedes with the smoking censer, followed by the subdeacon, bearing the processional cross between two acolytes carrying lighted candles.  Then follow the clergy in order of rank, then the celebrant with the deacon on his left.  Where it is custom for the people to join the procession, they follow the celebrant.  All carry palms, and all or some of them sing the following anthems, hymns, and Psalms, during the whole time the procession lasts.
_
v. The multitude goeth forth to meet our Redeemer with flowers and palms, and payeth the homage due to a triumphant Conqueror: the Gentiles proclaim the Son of God; and their voices thunder through the skies in praise of Christ: Hosanna in the highest!

Who sendeth forth His speech to the earth: His word runneth swiftly.
Who giveth snow like wool: scattereth mists like ashes.
He sendeth His crystal like morsels: Who shall stand before the face of His cold?
He shall send out His Word and shall melt them: His wind shall blow and the waters shall run.
Who declareth His word to Jacob: His justice and His judgements to Israel.
He hath not done in like manner to every nation: and His judgements He hath not made manifest to them.

Who livest and reignest for ever and ever.
