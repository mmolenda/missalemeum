! Afterwards the Priest, standing at the Epistle side, without turning towards the people, with his hands joined, says
P. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.
v. Let us pray. 
Almighty, everlasting God, spare those who are repentant, be merciful to those who pray to You, and graciously send Your holy angel from heaven to bless + and hallow + these ashes, that they may be a wholesome remedy for all who humbly implore Your holy Name; who accuse themselves by acknowledging their sins, who weep for their evil deeds in the sight of Your divine mercy; who humbly and earnestly seek Your fatherly love. Grant to us who call upon Your holy Name, that all who are sprinkled with these ashes for the forgiveness of their sins, may receive health for their bodies and salvation for their souls. Through Christ our Lord.

v. Let us pray. 
O God, You Who desire not the death but the repentance of sinners, look graciously upon the weakness of our human nature, and in Your fatherly love mercifully bless + these ashes which are to be placed upon our heads as a sign of humility and a pledge of Your forgiveness. We know that we are but ashes, and because of our wickedness must return to dust. May we obtain from Your mercy the pardon of all our sins and the rewards promised to those who repent. Through Christ our Lord.

v. Let us pray. 
O God, You Who are moved by our acts of humility and appeased by our works of penance, turn Your ear lovingly to our prayers, and by the ashes sprinkled upon the heads of Your servants mercifully pour forth upon them the grace of Your blessing, fill them with the spirit of repentance and truly grant what they ask for in the right way; and may whatever You grant remain fixed and unchanged always. Through Christ our Lord.

v. Let us pray. 
Almighty, everlasting God, Who bestowed upon the people of Niniveh, who repented in sackcloth and ashes, Your merciful remedies, graciously grant that we may so imitate their outward behavior as inwardly to obtain Your forgiveness.
$Per Dominum
(sed rubrica 1960 dicuntur)

!Postea Celebrans, imposito incenso in thuribulo, ter aspergit cineres aqua benedícta, dicendo Antiphonam Aspérges, sine cantu et sine Psalmo, et ter adolet incenso. Deinde dignior Sacerdos ex Clero accedens ad Altare, imponit cineres Celebranti non genuflexo. Si vero non adsit alius Sacerdos, ipsemet Celebrans, genibus flexis coram Altari, sibi ipsi cineres imponit in capite, nihil dicens, et cantatur statim a choro:
!Antiphona.
!Joel 2:13
Let us change our garment for ashes and sackcloth: let us fast and lament before the Lord: for our God is plenteous in mercy to forgive sins.

!Alia Antiph.
!Joel 2:17
Between the porch and the altar the priests the Lord's ministers shall weep, and shall say: Spare, O Lord, spare thy people: and shut not the mouths of them that sing to thee, O Lord?
_

!Responsorium
!Esther 13; Joel 2
Let us amend for the better in those things in which we have sinned through ignorance: lest suddenly overtaken by the day of death, we seek space for penance, and are not able to find it. Hear O Lord, and have mercy: for we have sinned against thee.
!Ps 78:9
Help us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us: and forgive us our sins for thy name's sake: O Lord deliver us. Listen, O Lord.
V. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. Listen, O Lord.
!Sacerdos vero, dum cantantur Antiphonæ et Responsorium, detecto capite, primo imponit cineres digniori Sacerdoti, a quo ipse accepit, deinde Ministris paratis, genibus flexis coram Altari, dicens:
!Imposition of the Ashes.
!Gen. 3:19 
Remember, man, that you are dust and into dust you shall return.
_

P. The Lord be with you. 
R. And with your spirit.
v. Let us pray. 
Grant us, O Lord, to take up our duty as soldiers of Christ by holy fasting that we, who are going to struggle with the evil spirits, may be protected by the help of self-restraint. Through Christ our Lord.
