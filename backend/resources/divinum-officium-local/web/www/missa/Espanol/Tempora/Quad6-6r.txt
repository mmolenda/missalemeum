[Benedictio ignis]
! At the appointed hour, the altar is prepared, but candles are not lit until the beginning of Mass. Meanwhile, fire is struck from a flint, and coals are enkindled from it.

! The celebrant vests in amice, alb, cincture, stole, and violet cope

! (the chasuble is not substituted); the sacred ministers vest in amice, alb, and cincture.

! The deacon vests in stole and dalmatic, the subdeacon vests in tunic of the same color. The ministers (and servers) with processional cross, holy water, and incense proceed to the doors, whether outside or in the entry to the church, whichever allows the greatest number of people to follow the Sacred Rites. The celebrant then blesses the new fire, saying in Ferial Tone B (or in the ancient simple tone) with hands joined:
_
_
_
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray.
O God, Who hast bestowed on the faithful the fire of Thy brightness by Thy Son, Who is the Cornerstone, hallow this new fire produced from a flint that it may be profitable to us: and grant that during this Paschal festival we may be so inflamed with heavenly desires, that with pure minds we may come to the solemnity of perpetual light. Through the same Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

! Then he sprinkles the fire thrice, in silence.
_

[De benedictione cerei Paschalis]
! One of the ministers carries the paschal candle and stands in front of the celebrant, who inscribes a cross between the openings, the Greek letter Alpha, and under the cross, the Greek letter Omega and between the arms of the cross he inscribes the four numbers of the current year.

! Carves fourth number of the year in bottom right corner of the cross
_
! With the incision of the cross and other symbols done, the deacon (or another minister) presents five grains of incense to the celebrant. If the grains have not been previously blessed, the celebrant sprinkles them thrice with holy water, and incenses them thrice, in silence. Then he inserts the five grains into their openings:

Through His holy
and glorious wounds
may Christ the Lord
preserve
and keep us. Amen.

! Then the deacon (or another minister) offers the celebrant a taper, lit from the new fire. The celebrant lights the Paschal candle and says audibly:

v. May the light of Christ, gloriously risen
Dispel the darkness of the heart and mind.
_
! The celebrant blesses the candle:

V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray.
May the abundant outpouring of Thy + blessing, we beseech Thee, almighty God, descend upon this incense: and do Thou, O invisible Regenerator, lighten this nocturnal brightness, that not only the sacrifice that is offered this night may shine by the secret mixture of Thy light: but also into whatever place anything of this mysterious sanctification shall be brought, there the power of Thy Majesty may be present and all the malicious artifices of Satan may be defeated. Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
_
! Meanwhile, all the lights in the church are put out. The clerics and people are given candles, which will be carried in procession and lit from the Paschal candle.
_
[De solemni processione]

[De praeconio paschali]
! The deacon receives the book and asks for the blessing

Sir, give me Thy blessing.

! Celebrant responses

C. May the Lord be on thy heart and on thy lips, that thou mayest worthily and fittingly proclaim His Paschal praise:
in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, + and of the Holy Ghost.

! Deacon responses:

Amen.

! The deacon goes to the lectern, places the book on the lecturn and incenses it; then he circles the Paschal candle, incensing it. Then all rise and remain standing, as they usually do when the Gospel is proclaimed at Mass, while the deacon sings or the celebrant sings or reads the Paschal proclamation.

v. Let the angelic choirs of Heaven now rejoice; let the divine Mysteries rejoice; and let the trumpet of salvation sound forth the victory of so great a King. Let the earth also rejoice, made radiant by such splendor; and, enlightened with the brightness of the eternal King, let it know that the darkness of the whole world is scattered. Let our mother the Church also rejoice, adorned with the brightness of so great a light; and let this temple resound with the loud acclamations of the people.  Wherefore I beseech you, most beloved brethren, who are here present in the wondrous brightness of this holy light, to invoke wtih me the mercy of almighty God. That He who has vouchsafed to admit me among the Levites, without any merits of mine, would pour forth the brightness of His light upon me, and enable me to perfect the praise of this wax candle.  Through our Lord Jesus Christ His Son, Who with Him and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth one God for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
V. Lift up thy hearts.
R. We have them lifted up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is meet and just.

v. It is truly meet and right to proclaim with all our heart and all the affection of our mind, and with the ministry of our voices, the invisible God, the Father almighty, and His only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ, who repaid for us to His eternal Father the debt of Adam, and by the merciful shedding of His Blood, cancelled the debt incurred by original sin. For this is the Paschal Festival; in which that true Lamb is slain, with Whose Blood the doorposts of the faithful are consecrated. This is the night in which Thou didst formerly cause our forefathers, the children of Israel, when brought out of Egypt, to pass through the Red Sea with dry foot. This, therefore, is the night which dissipated the darkness of sinners by the light of the pillar.  This is the night which at this time throughout the world restores to grace and unites in sanctity those that believe in Christ, and are separated from the vices of the world and the darkness of sinners.  This is the night in which, destroying the chains of death, Christ arose victorious from the grave. For it would have profited us nothing to have been born, unless redemption had also been bestowed upon us. O wondrous condescension of Thy mercy towards us! O inestimable affection of love: that Thou mightest redeem a slave, Thou didst deliver up Thy Son! O truly needful sin of Adam, which was blotted out by the death of Christ! O happy fault, that merited to possess such and so great a Redeemer! O truly blessed night, which alone deserved to know the time and hour when Christ rose again from hell! This is the night of which it is written: And the night shall be as clear as the day; and the night is my light in my delights.  Therefore the hallowing of this night puts to flight all wickedness, cleanses sins, and restores innocence to the fallen, and gladness to the sorrowful. It drives forth hatreds, it prepares concord, and brings down haughtiness.

Wherefore, in this sacred night, receive, O holy Father, the evening sacrifice of this incense, which holy Church renders to Thee by the hands of Thy ministers in the solemn offering of this wax candle, made out the work of bees.  Now also we know the praises of this pillar, which the shining fire enkindles to the honor of God. Which fire, although divided into parts, suffers no loss from its light being borrowed. For it is nourished by the melting wax, which the mother bee produced for the substance of this precious light.  O truly blessed night, which plundered the Egyptians and enriched the Hebrews! A night in which heavenly things are united to those of earth, and things divine to those which are of man.

We beseech Thee, therefore, O Lord, that this wax candle hallowed in honor of Thy Name, may continue to burn to dissipate the darkness of this night. And being accepted as a sweet savor, may be united with the heavenly lights. Let the morning star find its flame alight. That star, I mean, which knows no setting. He Who returning from hell, serenely shone forth upon mankind.  We beseech Thee therefore, O Lord, that Thou wouldst grant peaceful times during this Paschal Festival, and vouchsafe to rule, govern, and keep with Thy constant protection us Thy servants, and all the clergy, and the devout people, together with our most holy Father, Pope N., and our Bishop N.. Have regard, also, for those who reign over us, and, grant them Thine ineffable kindness and mercy, direct their thoughts in justice and peace, that from their earthy toil, they may come to their heavenly reward with all Thy people.  Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, who with Thee liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God: World without end. R. Amen.

! After the Paschal proclamation is completed, all extinguish their candles and are seated.

[De lectionibus]
! The deacon, at the sedilia or some other appropriate place, lays aside his white vestments and again vests in violet. The subdeacon, giving the processional cross to the master of ceremonies, returns to his place. An acolyte removes the white drape from the lecturn, or places another undecorated lecturn in front of it.  The lectors in choir dress make a reverence toward the altar, then go to the lecturn and read the readings, facing the Paschal candle, which is to the right hand (the Gospel side) of the altar, toward the left side (liturgical north) of the church. The readings are read without title, and the response Deo gratias is not made.

!Gen. 1:1-31; 2:1-2
!x! Bóg stworzył cały widzialny świat dla człowieka, a jego samego uczynił na obraz i podobieństwo swoje. Obraz ten został zeszpecony przez grzech pierworodny. Przez Chrzest święty Pan Bóg odnawia swój obraz w człowieku, przywracając mu utracone synostwo Boże.
In the beginning, God created heaven and earth. And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved over the water. And God said: Be light made. And light was made. And God saw the light that it was good: and He divided the light from the darkness. And He called the light Day, and the darkness Night: and there was evening and morning, one day. And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament from those that were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and morning were the second day. God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven be gathered together into one place; and let the dry land appear. And it was so done. And God called the dry land Earth: and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good. And He said: Let the earth bring forth his green herb, after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done. And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as tieldeth seed according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And the evening and morning were the third day. And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.: to shine in the firmament of heaven. and to give light to the earth. And it was so done. And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars. And He set them in the firmament of heaven, to shine upon the earth, and to rule the day and the night, and to divide the earth, and to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And the evening and morning were the fourth day. God also said: Let het waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven. And God created the great whales, and every living thing and moving creature which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And He blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds. And it was so done. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good. And He said: Let us make man to His own image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth. And God created man to His own image: to the image of God He created him, male and female He created them. And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth. And God said: Behold, I have given you every herb-bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind to be your meat: and to all the beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done. And God saw all the things that He had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day. So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made: and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.

!Exo. 14:24-31; 15:1
In those days, it came to pass in the morning watch, and behold the Lord looking upon the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, slew their host: and overthrew the wheels of the chariots, and they were carried into the deep. And the Egyptians said: Let us flee from Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against us. And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand over the sea, that the waters may com again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and horsemen. And when Moses had stretched forth his hand towards the sea, it returned at the first break of day to the former place: and as the Egyptians were fleeing away the waters came upon them, and the Lord shut them up in the middle of the waves. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the army of Pharao, who had come into the sea after them: neither did there so much as one of them remain. But the children of Israel marched through the midst of the sea upon dry land, and the waters were to them as a wall on the right hand and the left: and the Lord delivered Israel on that day out of the hand of the Egyptians. And they saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore, and the mighty hand of the Lord had used against them: and the people feared the Lord, and they believed the Lord, and Moses His servant. Then Moses and the children of Israel sung this canticle to the Lord, and said:

In that day the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence and glory, and the fruit of the earth shall be high, and a great joy to them that shall have escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall be left in Sion, and that shall remain in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written in life in Jerusalem. If the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Sion, and shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. And the Lord will create upon every place of mount Sion, and where he is called upon, a cloud by day, and a smoke and the brightness of a flaming fire in the night: for over all the glory shall be a protection. And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a security and covert from the whirlwind, and from rain.

!Deut. 31:22-30
In those days: Moses therefore wrote the canticle, and taught it to the children of Israel. And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun, and said: Take courage, and be valiant: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have promised, and I will be with thee. Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a volume, and finished it: he commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying: Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God: that it may be there for a testimony against thee. For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck. While I am yet living, and going in with you, you have always been rebellious against the Lord: how much more when I shall be dead? Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes, and your doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will call heaven and earth to witness against them. For I know that, after my death, you will do wickedly, and will quickly turn aside form the way that I have commanded you: and evils shall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him by the works of your hands. Moses therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel, the words of this canticle, and finished it even to the end:

[De benedictione aquae baptismalis]
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray
Almighty and everlasting God, be present at these Mysteries of Thy great kindness, be present at these Sacraments: and send forth Thy Spirit of adoption to regenerate the new people, whom the font of baptism brings forth; that what is to be done by our humble ministry may be accomplished by the effect of Thy power. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God:
v. World without end.
R. Amen.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
V. Lift up thy hearts.
R. We have them lifted up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God..
R. It is meet and just.

v. It is meet and just, right and availing unto salvation, to give Thee thanks always and in all places, O holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God, Who, by Thine ineffable power dost wonderfully produce the effect of Thy Sacraments: and though we are unworthy to perform such great mysteries: yet, as Thou dost not abandon the gifts of Thy grace, so Thou inclinest the ears of Thy goodness, even to our prayers. O God, Whose Spirit in the very beginning of the world moved over the waters, that even then the nature of water might receive the virtue of sanctification. O God, Who by water didst wash away the crimes of the guilty world, and by the pouring out of the deluge didst give a figure of regeneration, that one and the same element might in a mystery be the end of vice and the beginning of virtue. Look, O Lord, on the face of Thy Church, and multiply in her Thy regenerations, who by the streams of Thine abundant grace fillest Thy city with joy, and openest the font of Baptism all over the world for the renewal of the Gentiles: that by the command of Thy Majesty she may receive the grace of Thine only Son from the Holy Ghost.

! Here the celebrant, with outstretched hand, divides the water in the form of a cross, and wiping his hand with a towel, says:

v. May He by a secret mixture of His divine virtue render this water fruitful for the regeneration of men, to the end that a heavenly offspring, conceived by sanctification, may emerge from the immaculate womb of this divine font, reborn a new creature: and may all, however distinguished either by sex in body, or by age in time, be brought forth to the same infancy by grace, their mother. Therefore may all unclean spirits, by Thy command, O Lord, depart far from hence: may the whole malice of diabolical deceit be entirely banished: may no power of the enemy prevail here: let him not fly about to lay his snares; may he not creep in by stealth: may he not corrupt with his poison.

! Touches the water

v. May this holy and innocent creature be free from all the assaults of the enemy, and purified by the destruction of all his wickedness. May it be a living fountain, a regenerating water, a purifying stream: that all those that are to be washed in this saving bath may obtain, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, the grace of a perfect cleansing.
v. Therefore, I bless thee, O creature of water, by the living + God, by the true + God, by the holy + God: by that God Who, in the beginning, separated thee by His Word from the dry land, Whose Spirit moved over thee.

! Here he divides the water and casts some toward the four corners of the earth, saying:

v. Who made thee flow from the fountain of paradise and commanded thee to water the whole earth with thy four rivers. Who, changing thy bitterness in the desert into sweetness made thee fit to drink, and produced thee out of a rock to quench the thirsty people. I bless + thee also by our Lord Jesus Christ, His only Son: Who in Cana of Galilee changed thee into wine by a wonderful miracle of His power. Who walked upon thee with dry foot, and was baptized in thee by John in the Jordan. Who made thee flow out of His side together with His Blood, and commanded His disciples that such as believed should be baptised in thee, saying: Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

! He changes his voice and proceeds in the tone of the Lesson.

v.Do thou, almighty God, mercifully assist us who observe this commandment: do Thou graciously inspire us.

! He breathes on the water three times in the shape of the Cross.

v. Do Thou with Thy mouth bless these clear waters: that besides their natural virtue of cleansing the body, they may also prove efficacious for the purifying of the soul.

! He lowers the Paschal candle into the water, and sings in the tone of the Preface:

v. May the virtue of the Holy Ghost descend into all the water of this font.

! Then breathing upon the water three times in the form of the Greek letter &Psi;, he repeats the following verse three times:

v. And make the whole substance of this water fruitful for regeneration.

! Here the Paschal candle is taken out of the water, and he continues:

v. Here may the stains of all sins be washed out; here may human nature, created in v. Here may the stains of all sins be washed out; here may human nature, created in v. Here may the stains of all sins be washed out; here may human nature, created in Thine image, and reformed to the honor of its Author, be cleansed from all the filth of the old man: that all who receive the Sacrament of regeneration, may be born again new children of true innocence. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son: Who shall come to judge the living and the dead, and the world by fire. R. Amen.
_
_
! The celebrant who blessed the water pours the Oil of Catechumens into the water

v. May this font be sanctified and made fruitful by the Oil of salvation, for those who are born anew therein unto life everlasting.
R. Amen.

! Then he pours Holy Chrism into the water in the shape of the Cross, saying:

v. May the infusion of the Chrism of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost the Comforter, be made in the Name of the Holy Trinity. R. Amen.

! Then he takes both the vials of the Oil of Catechemens and the Holy Chrism, and pours them both into the water three times in the shape of the Cross, saying:

v. May this mixture of the Chrism of sanctification, and of the Oil of unction, and of the water of Baptism, be made to the Name of the + Father, + and of the Son, and of the Holy + Ghost.
R. Amen.
_
! He then mixes the Oil and Chrism with the water. If there are any to be baptized, the Sacrament of Baptism here follows in the usual manner, according to Title II of the Rituale Romanum. If there are many to be baptized, certain alterations may be made so that the Baptismal rite is performed collectively rather than individually. If a bishop with jurisdiction is present, the neophytes may then receive the Sacrament of Confirmation. The blessing having been given, and the neophytes (if any) having been baptized, the baptismal water is now carried in solemn procession to the baptistry. The celebrant puts incense into the thurible, and the procession is formed in the following order:  a.) the thurifer precedes with the thurible  b.) the subdeacon of the Cross or crucifer with processional cross  c.) the clergy or servers  d.) the subdeacon and deacon or servers carrying the baptismal water  e.) finally, the celebrant, with covered head The Paschal candle remains in its place. During the procession, the following hymn is sung:
!Ps 41:2-4
v. As the hart panteth after the fountains of water, so my soul panteth after Thee, O God.
V. My soul hath thirsted for the living God: when shall I come and appear before the face of God?
V. My tears have become my bread day and night, while they say to me daily: Where is thy God?
_
! The baptismal water is poured into the font, and the celebrant with hands joined sings in ferial tone A (or the ancient simple tone):
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
v. Let us pray.
O Almighty and everlasting God, look mercifully on the devotion of Thy people about to be reborn, who like the hart pant after the fountain of Thy waters: and mercifully grant that the thirst of their faith may, by the Sacrament of Baptism, hallow their souls and bodies.

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who with Thee liveth and reigneth in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.
R. Amen.
_
! If the baptistry is separate from the body of the Church, it may be preferable to bless the baptismal water in the font in the Baptistry. If this is the case, the clergy and servers form a procession when the cantors sing 'Sancta Trinitas, unus Deus', miserere nobis in the Litanies. The cantors remain in the sanctuary singing the Litany, if necessary repeating it from the line 'Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis', and the psalm 'Sicut cervus desiderat follows'. Upon arrival at the entrance to the baptistry, the celebrant says the prayer 'Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, respice propitius', the font is filled, and the blessing occurs as described above. Afterwards, the clergy and servers return to the church in silence.

[De renovatione promissionum baptismatis]

! The celebrant Then he stands in front of the candle, facing the people, or from the ambo or pulpit, proceeds with the renewal of baptismal promises. All stand, holding lit candles.

v. On this most sacred night, dearly beloved brethren, Holy Mother Church, recalling the death and burial of Our Lord Jesus Christ, returneth His love by keeping vigil; and aboundeth with joy at celebrating His glorious Resurrection.


v. But because, as the Apostle teaches, we are baptised into His death and buried together with Christ: and as Christ rose again from the dead, so we too must walk in newness of life; knowing that our old man hath been crucified together with Christ so that we shall no longer be in servitude to sin. Let us therefore look upon ourselves therefore as dead indeed to sin but living to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.


v. Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, the Lenten observance now completed, let us renew the promises of baptism by which formerly we renounced Satan and his works, and the world likewise, the enemy of God; and by which we promised to serve God faithfully in the Holy Catholic Church.


Therefore:
S. Do you renounce Satan?
A. We do renounce him.
S. And all his works?
A. We do renounce them.
S. And all his pomps?
A. We do renounce them.
S. Do you believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?
A. We do believe.
S. Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was born into this world and who suffered for us?
A. We do believe.
S. Do you also believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the Communionion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?
A. We do believe.
S. And now let us pray together as one, just as our Lord Jesus Christ taught us to pray:



A. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

S. And may God almighty, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath regenerated us by water and the Holy Ghost, and who hath given us remission of sins, may He by His grace keep us in the same Christ Jesus our Lord to life everlasting.
A. Amen.

! Then the celebrant spinkles the people with the blessed baptismal water.

[De altera parte Litaniarum]
! After the renewal of baptismal promises, if there are cantors or clerics present to sing the litany, the celebrant and sacred ministers or servers reverence the altar, then retire to the sacristy. If there are no cantors, the celebrant himself kneels before the altar on the lowest step, on the epistle side, and sings or recites the litany, beginning with the verse Propitius esto unto the end.

[De Missa solemni Vigiliae paschalis]
! At the end of the litany, the cantors solemnly intone the 'Kyrie, eleison' as the celebrant and the sacred ministers or servers come to the altar.

! The celebrant reverences the altar and, omitting the psalm 'Judica me, Deus' and the public confession, ascends the altar. Omitting the usual prayer, he kisses the center of the altar, then he blesses and imposes incense and incenses the altar in the usual manner.

! In the simple rite, if Mass is to be sung, incense may be used in the same manner as in solemn Mass.

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.
R. Amen.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the Epistle of Blessed Paul the Apostle to the Colossians.
!Col 3:1-4
Brethren, if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God: mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth. For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ should appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with Him in glory.
$Deo gratias

[Evangelium]
! While singing the Gospel candles are not being hold.

Continuation of the holy Gospel according to St. Matthew.
!Matt 28:1-7
And in the end of the Sabbath, when it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And behold there was a great earthquake. For an Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone and sat upon it: and his countenance was as lightening and his raiment as snow. And for fear of him the guards were struck with terror and became as dead men. And the Angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you: for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified: He is not here: for His is risen, as He said. Come and see the place where the Lord was laid. And going quickly, tell ye His disciples that He is risen: and behold He will go before you into Galilee: there you shall see Him. Lo, I have foretold it to you.

v. It it truly meet and just, right and for our salvation, at all times to praise Thee, O Lord, but more gloriously especially this night when Christ our Pasch was sacrificed. For He is the Lamb Who hath taken away the sins of the world: Who by dying hath destroyed our death: and by rising again hath restored us to life. And therefore with Angels and Archangels, with Thrones and Dominations, and with all the hosts of the heavenly army, we sing the hymn of Thy glory, evermore saying:
