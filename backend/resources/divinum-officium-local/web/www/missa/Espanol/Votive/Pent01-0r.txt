! In Votive Masses from Septuagesima to Easter
With our whole heart and voice we confess Thee, we praise Thee, we bless~
Thee, God the Father unbegotten, Thee, the only-begotten Son, Thee the Holy~
Ghost, the Paraclete, the holy and undivided Trinity.
V. For Thou art great and dost wonderful things: Thou alone art God.
V. To Thee be praise, to Thee glory, to Thee thanksgiving, for ever and ever, O blessed Trinity!

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to St. John.
!John 15:26, 16:1-4
At that time Jesus said to His disciples: When the Paraclete cometh, whom~
I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from~
the Father, He shall give testimony to Me: and you shall give testimony~
because you are with Me from the beginning. These things I have spoken to~
you, that you may not be scandalized. They will put you out of the synagogues:~
yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doth a~
service to God. And these things will they do to you, because they have not~
known the Father, nor Me. But these things I have told you, that, when the~
hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.
