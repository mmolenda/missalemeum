Lesson from the book of Revelation
! Apoc 5:11-14
In those days: I heard the voice of many Angels round about the throne, and~
the living creatures and the ancients; and the number of them was thousands~
of thousands, saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy~
to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and~
glory, and benediction. And every creature which is in heaven and on the~
earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are~
in them, I heard all saying: To Him that sitteth on the throne, and to the~
Lamb, benediction, and honor, and glory, and power, for ever and ever. And~
the four living creatures said: Amen. And the four and twenty ancients fell~
down on their faces, and adored Him that liveth for ever and ever.

At that time: Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him: and He saith of him: Behold~
an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile. Nathanael saith to Him: Whence~
knowest Thou me? Jesus answered, and said to him: Before that Philip called~
thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered Him,~
and said: Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God, Thou art the King of Israel. Jesus~
answered, and said to him: Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the~
fig-tree, thou believest: greater things than these shalt thou see. And He~
said to him: Amen, amen I say to you, you shall see the heavens opened, and~
the Angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.
