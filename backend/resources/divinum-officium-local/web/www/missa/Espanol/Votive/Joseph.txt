[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Genesis
! Gen 49:22-26
Joseph was a growing son, a growing son, and comely to behold: the daughters~
run to and fro upon the wall. But they that held darts provoked him, and~
quarreled with him, and envied him. His bow rested upon the strong, and~
the bands of his arms and his hands were loosed, by the hands of the~
mighty one of Jacob: thence he came forth a pastor, the stone of Israel.~
The God of thy father shall be thy helper, and the Almighty shall bless~
thee with the blessings of heaven above, with the blessings of the deep~
that lieth beneath, with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb.~
The blessings of thy father are strengthened with the blessings of his~
fathers: until the desire of the everlasting hills shall come; may~
they be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite~
among his brethren.

[Graduale]
! Ps 20:4-5
O lord, Thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness; Thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.
V. He asked life of Thee, and Thou hast given him length of days for ever and ever. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. Obtain for us, Joseph, grace to lead an innocent life; and may our life ever be shielded by thy patronage. Alleluia.

[GradualeP]
! In Eastertide
Alleluia, alleluia.
V. In whatever tribulation they shall cry to Me, I will hear them, and be their protection always. Alleluia.
V. Obtain for us, Joseph, grace to lead an innocent life; and may it ever be shielded by thy patronage. Alleluia.

[Tractus]

Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he shall delight exceedingly in His command-ments.

V. Glory and wealth shall be in his house: and His justice remaineth for ever and ever.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 3:21-23
At that time: It came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that Jesus~
also being baptized and praying, heaven was opened: and the Holy Ghost descended~
in a bodily shape as a dove upon Him: and a voice came from heaven: Thou art My~
beloved Son, in Thee I am well pleased. And Jesus Himself was beginning about~
the age of thirty years, being (as it was supposed) the son of Joseph.

[Offertorium]
! Ps 147:12-13
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem, because He hath strengthened the bolts of thy gates:~
He hath blessed thy children within thee. (P.T.Alleluia.)

[Secreta]
Supported by the patronage of the spouse of Thy most holy Mother, we beseech~
Thy clemency, O Lord: that Thou wouldst make our hearts despise all earthly~
things, and love Thee, the true God, with perfect charity:
$Qui vivis
