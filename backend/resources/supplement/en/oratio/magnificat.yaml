        _Luk 1:46-55_   
        My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, &#42;   
        my spirit rejoices &#42;  
        in God my Savior;   
        for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant. &#42;  
        From this day all generations will call me blessed:  
        the Almighty has done great things for me, &#42;  
        and holy is His Name.  
        He has mercy on those who fear him &#42;  
        in every generation.  
      
        He has shown the strength of his arm, &#42;   
        he has scattered the proud in their conceit.   
        He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, &#42;   
        and has lifted up the lowly.   
        He has filled the hungry with good things, &#42;   
        and the rich he has sent away empty.   
        He has come to the help of his servant, Israel, &#42;   
        for he has remembered his promise of mercy,   
        the promise he made to our fathers, &#42;   
        to Abraham and his children for ever.   
      
        Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, &#42;   
        and to the Holy Ghost.   
        As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, &#42;   
        world without end. Amen.

        _Luc 1:46-55_   
        MAGNÍFICAT &#42; ánima mea Dóminum,   
        et exsultávit spíritus meus &#42;   
        in Deo salutári meo;   
        quia respéxit humilitátem ancíllæ suæ, &#42;   
        ecce enim ex hoc beátam me dicent omnes generatiónes.   
        Quia fecit mihi magna, qui potens est: &#42;   
        et sanctum nomen eius,   
        et misericórdia eius a progénie in progénies &#42;   
        timéntibus eum.   
      
        Fecit poténtiam in bráchio suo, &#42;   
        dispérsit supérbos mente cordis sui,   
        depósuit poténtes de sede, &#42;   
        et exaltávit húmiles,   
        esuriéntes implévit bonis, &#42;   
        et dívites dimísit inánes.   
        Suscépit Israel, púerum suum, &#42;   
        recordátus misericórdiæ suæ,   
        sicut locútus est ad patres nostros, &#42;   
        Abraham et sémini eius in sæcula.   
      
        Glória Patri, et Fílio, &#42;   
        et Spirítui Sancto.   
        Sicut erat in princípio, et nunc et semper, &#42;   
        et in sæcula sæculórum. Amen.
