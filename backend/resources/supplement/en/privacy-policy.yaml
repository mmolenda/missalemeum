        We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This policy explains what information 
        we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have.  

        ### Hosting and Data Location
        Our server is located in the European Union. Any data processed through our website is handled within the EU or 
        y third-party services that comply with GDPR and other applicable privacy regulations.  

        ### Analytics and Logging
        To operate and improve our website, we use the following services:  

        - **Simple Analytics** – We use [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/) to understand how visitors use 
        our website. This service does not use cookies and does not collect any personal data. It only provides us with 
        aggregated, anonymous statistics (for example, which pages are most visited).  

        - **Cloudflare Analytics** – Our website traffic is routed through Cloudflare. Cloudflare provides us with basic 
        traffic analytics and may set cookies to ensure security and network performance.  

        - **Grafana Cloud Logs** – We use Grafana Cloud to collect server logs. These logs may contain IP addresses and 
        technical information (such as browser type, time of access, or error messages). This information is used solely 
        for troubleshooting and ensuring the stability and security of the website.  

        ### Cookies and Browser Storage
        We do not set cookies of our own. However, some of the third-party services listed above (such as Cloudflare) may 
        set cookies as part of their operation.  

        We also store certain user preferences (for example, interface or display settings) in your browser’s **local storage**. 
        This information never leaves your device and is not shared with us or third parties.  

        ### Your Rights
        If you are located in the European Union, you have the right to:  
        - Access the data we process about you,  
        - Request correction or deletion of your personal data,  
        - Restrict or object to certain processing,  
        - File a complaint with your local data protection authority.
