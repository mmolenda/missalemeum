        Website **Missale Meum** has been established for God's greater glory and for people's avail. The site incorporates 
        a complete liturgical calendar with propers and other texts used in the Tridentine Mass and presents them in a 
        comprehensible manner.

        English and Latin texts come from the venerable website [Divinum Officium](https://www.divinumofficium.com/).
        Some parts of Ordo have been borrowed from [Fish Eaters](https://www.fisheaters.com/). The project's codebase 
        is available in [github repository](https://github.com/mmolenda/missalemeum). This website is a private project 
        and does not represent any official organization or group.
