        O Jesus, meek and humble of heart, hear me.  
        From the desire of being esteemed, deliver me, Jesus.  
        From the desire of being loved,  
        From the desire of being extolled,  
        From the desire of being honored,  
        From the desire of being praised,  
        From the desire of being preferred to others,  
        From the desire of being consulted,  
        From the desire of being approved,  
        From the fear of being humiliated,  
        From the fear of being despised,  
        From the fear of suffering rebukes,  
        From the fear of being calumniated,  
        From the fear of being forgotten,  
        From the fear of being ridiculed,  
        From the fear of being wronged,  
        From the fear of being suspected,  

        That others may be loved more than I, Jesus, grant me the grace to desire it.  
        That others may be esteemed more than I,  
        That in the opinion of the world, others may increase and I may decrease,  
        That others may be chosen and I set aside,  
        That others may be praised and I unnoticed,  
        That others may be preferred to me in everything,  
        That others may become holier than I, provided that I become as holy as I should,

        O Jesu, mitis et humilis corde, exaudi me.  
        A desiderio, ut amer, libera me Domine.  
        A desiderio, ut exalter,  
        A desiderio, ut honorer,  
        A desiderio, ut lauder,  
        A desiderio, ut aliis praeterear,  
        A desiderio, ut consular,  
        A desiderio, ut approber,  
        A timore, ne humilier,  
        A timore, ne spernar,  
        A timore, ne contemnar,  
        A timore, ne calumniam feram,  
        A timore, ne oblivioni tradar,  
        A timore, ne irridear,  
        A timore, ne iniuriam accipiam,  
        A timore, ne suspiciar,  

        Ut magis alii amentur quam ego, Iesu, da mihi gratiam ita desiderandi.  
        Ut plus alii aestimentur quam ego, Iesu,  
        Ut alii extollantur in mundi existimatione, ego autem minuar, Iesu,  
        Ut alii eligantur, ego autem praeterear, Iesu,  
        Ut alii mihi in omnibus rebus praeferantur, Iesu,  
        Ut alii me, dum sanctus fieri debeam, sanctiores sint, Iesu,
