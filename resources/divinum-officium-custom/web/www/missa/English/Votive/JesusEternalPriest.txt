[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews
!Heb 5:11-1
Brethren: Every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in the~
things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for~
sins: who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because~
he himself also is compassed with infirmity. And there-fore he ought, as for~
the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. Neither doth any man take~
the honor to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was. So Christ~
also did not glorify himself, that He might be made a high priest: but He that~
said unto Him: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee. As He saith also~
in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of~
Melchisedech. Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears,~
offering up prayers and supplications to Him that was able to save Him from~
death, was heard for His reverence. And whereas in-deed He was the Son of God,~
He learned obedience by the things which He suffered: and being consummated,~
He became, to all that obey Him, the cause of eternal salva-tion. Called by~
God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech. Of whom we have much~
to say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered.

[Evangelium]
Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 22:14-20
At that time: Jesus sat down, and the twelve Apostles with Him. And He said~
to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I~
suffer. For I say to you that from this time I will not eat it, till it be~
fulfilled in the kingdom of God. And having taken the chalice, He gave thanks~
and said: Take and divide among you. For I say to you that I will not drink of~
the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come. And taking bread, He gave~
thanks and broke and gave to them, saying: This is My Body, which is given for~
you. Do this for a commemoration of Me. In like manner, the chalice also, after~
He had supped, saying: This is the chalice the new testament in My Blood, which~
shall be shed for you.

[Offertorium]
! Heb 10:12, 10:14

O Lord, may our Mediator Jesus Christ make these offerings agreeable to Thee: and~
along with Himself may He offer us to Thee as a thank-offering:

[Postcommunio]
We beseech Thee, O Lord, may the divine host which we have offered up and received,~
quicken us; that, bound to Thee by an eternal love, we may bear fruit that will abide for ever.
