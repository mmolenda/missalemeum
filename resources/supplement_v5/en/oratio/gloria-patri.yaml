        Glory be to the Father, and to the Son:
        and to the Holy Ghost;
        As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:
        world without end. Amen.

        Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto.   
        Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper,   
        et in saecula  saeculorum. Amen.
