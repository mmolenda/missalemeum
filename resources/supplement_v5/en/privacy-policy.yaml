        2. The collected data is sent in two ways:
        
            a) information provided directly and voluntarily by the User in the contact form

            - time of sending the response by the server,
            - the IP address of the User's device,
            - the User's request (address of the page the User entered),
            - "referrer link" address if the website was accessed via a link,
            - information about the version of the User's web browser,
            - information about the version of the User's operating system.
        
        3. As part of the operation of the Missale Meum website, cookies are also used, which are saved in the Users' 
        end devices. Cookie files are small text files sent by the visited website to the User's device.
        
        4. Each User can individualize their cookie settings in the browser. If you do not change these settings, 
        this means that you accept the cookies used by the Missale Meum service.
        
        5. Most often, web browsers allow cookies to be stored on the User's computer by default. Internet users can 
        change these settings by themselves at any time, including blocking cookies. It should be remembered, however, 
        that changes to cookie settings consisting in limiting their use may cause that some functions of the 
        Missale Meum website may not work properly.
        
        6. The Missale Meum website uses cookies to only support statistics scripts.
