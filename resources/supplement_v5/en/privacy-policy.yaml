        1. By using the Missale Meum website, you accept the Privacy Policy.
        
        2. The collected data is sent in two ways:
        
            a) information provided directly and voluntarily by the User in the contact form
            
            b) information obtained during the use of the website by Users. The servers automatically collect the following User data:
            
            - time of sending the response by the server,
            - the IP address of the User's device,
            - the User's request (address of the page the User entered),
            - "referrer link" address if the website was accessed via a link,
            - information about the version of the User's web browser,
            - information about the version of the User's operating system.
        
        3. As part of the operation of the Missale Meum website, cookies are also used, which are saved in the Users' 
        end devices. Cookie files are small text files sent by the visited website to the User's device.

        4. The Missale Meum website uses two types of cookies:
        
            a) "session" (session cookies, session storage) - temporary files that are stored on the User's end device 
            until the session expires (e.g. leaving the website, deleting them by the User or turning off the browser).
            
            b) "permanent" (persistent cookies, local storage) - stored on the User's end device for the time specified 
            in the cookie file parameters or until they are deleted by the User.
        
        5. Each User can individualize their cookie settings in the browser. If you do not change these settings, 
        this means that you accept the cookies used by the Missale Meum service.
        
        6. Most often, web browsers allow cookies to be stored on the User's computer by default. Internet users can 
        change these settings by themselves at any time, including blocking cookies. It should be remembered, however, 
        that changes to cookie settings consisting in limiting their use may cause that some functions of the 
        Missale Meum website may not work properly.
        
        7. The Missale Meum website uses cookies to:
        
            - support statistics scripts,
            - saving website settings between subsequent visits
          
        8. For the above purposes, Missale Meum uses Internet tracking technologies that are common on the market for 
        traffic monitoring. The Missale Meum website collects anonymous data about the websites you visit, such as:
        
            - number of unique visits/views,
            - country,
            - browser,
            - visit time.
            - Data is collected using third-party solutions. We currently use Google Analytics. Please read 
            the details of the [Google Analytics privacy policy](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245).
        
        9. We reserve the right to change the Privacy Policy by publishing its new content on the website www.missalemeum.com.
